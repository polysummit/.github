## 🚀 About Us

Welcome to our GitHub organization! PolySummit is an Open Source Community from the [SUSTech VIP Lab](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&go=2&lang=en), exploring the frontiers of **3D Reconstruction and Generation**. Our key research areas include:

- 🧊 **3D Reconstruction**: Reconstructing detailed and accurate 3D models from images, point clouds, and other sensor data.
- 🤖 **Articulated Object Generation**: Understanding and generating 3D models of objects with movable parts and complex joint structures.
- 🏠 **Indoor Scene Layout Generation**: Generating realistic, semantically structured indoor environments for simulation and virtual interaction.
- 🕺 **Human Motion Generation**: Modeling and synthesizing expressive, natural human motions from diverse inputs.

We are committed to building high-quality open-source tools and sharing cutting-edge research that bridges academia and real-world applications in computer vision, robotics, and 3D content creation.
