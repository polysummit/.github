PolySummit is an open-source community from the [SUSTech VIP Lab](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&go=2&lang=en), exploring the frontiers of **3D reconstruction and generation**. Our research focuses on:

- 🧊 **3D Reconstruction**: &nbsp; Building accurate 3D models from images, videos, and sensor data.
- 🤖 **Articulated Object Generation**: &nbsp; Modeling objects with joints and movable parts.
- 🏠 **Indoor Scene Layout Generation**: &nbsp; Creating realistic, structured indoor environments.
- 🕺 **Human Motion Generation**: &nbsp; Synthesizing expressive and natural human movements.

We aim to develop high-quality open-source tools and share research that bridges academia and real-world applications.
